# cortanaISO
Disc utility for XBMC4Xbox.

## Features:
- Back up your games directly to your system as either ISO or HDD folders, all with the click of a button! (XISO support planned!)
- Get ETAs, file transfer speeds, and more! And if you're not interested in all of that, you can run the script in the background and have it only notify you when a certain amount of progress has been made!
- Easily change ISO/XISO/HDD settings in the Script Settings menu! Enable/disable different output formats, run the script in background mode, and more!

## Planned:
- ACL patches (or something like them) for games that don't play nicely with FATX character limits.
- XISO support (aiming for "rebuilt" mode at minimum)
